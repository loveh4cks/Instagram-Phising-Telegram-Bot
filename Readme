# 🚨 Instagram Phishing Telegram Bot  

🔥 **My Social Engineering & Phishing Project: How Attackers Exploit Social Engineering**  
> ⚠️ *For Educational and Research Purposes Only* ♥️  

---

## 📌 What I Built  

To demonstrate **real-world phishing attack scenarios**, I built a **Telegram-integrated phishing framework** that shows how attackers can capture and exfiltrate sensitive information through **social engineering techniques**.

It simulates data capture such as:  
✅ **Personal details**  
✅ **Instagram logins**  
✅ **Gmail logins**  
✅ **IP lookup information**  

> 🧠 This project’s purpose is to **educate cybersecurity learners** on how phishing and social engineering attacks operate — **not** to be used maliciously.

## 🛠️ How It Works  

### 🔗 URL Format  
www.example.com/?bt=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN&id=YOUR_CHAT_ID

- `bt` → Your Telegram **bot token**  
- `id` → Your Telegram **chat ID**

### 🔹 Dynamic Functionality  
- The **bot token** in the URL determines where captured data is sent.  
- This makes it **adaptable** to different phishing simulations and **real-time monitoring** via Telegram.

### 🔹 Advanced URL Masking  
- To study deception techniques, I experimented with **Instagram’s official redirection service**.  
- This masking technique makes a malicious URL appear **more legitimate**.

## 🎯 Demo: URL Masking in Action  

For example, this **Instagram redirection** link appears safe but actually redirects users to **Amazon**:

🔗 [https://l.instagram.com/?u=www.amazon.com&e=AT1cFsJSN4oeOytv_GYdC77kcXOpQRtjKlg91u0AH7LzlfwNVCieumBSP4YcE4IINxHtU8oBBAyoKXnGxeZTZQUoH1mPdCjsxL-xgLQy9X-BaQuzJh3J9JQ](https://l.instagram.com/?u=www.amazon.com&e=AT1cFsJSN4oeOytv_GYdC77kcXOpQRtjKlg91u0AH7LzlfwNVCieumBSP4YcE4IINxHtU8oBBAyoKXnGxeZTZQUoH1mPdCjsxL-xgLQy9X-BaQuzJh3J9JQ)  

📌 This demonstrates how **URL redirection** can make phishing links appear legitimate — a valuable insight for defenders.
